	Master Steve Sapp
	</h1>
        <p style="text-align:center;font-size:14pt;">
		<b>In 1973, Master Sapp began his Tae Kwon Do training under Randy Burch, 1st degree. <br>
		Concurrently, Grandmaster E.C. Ahn, originally from North Korea, <br>
		opened his training school in Macon teaching traditional Tae Kwon Do. At <br>
		that time, Master Sapp continued his training under the suberb teaching <br>
		of Grandmaster Ahn.  In October of 1974, Master Sapp received his first <br>
		degree black belt and opened his own school, Warner Robins Karate Academy.  (WRKA) <br>
		Master Sapp's will and determination during those early years is <br>
		reason for the success of Warner Robins Karate Academy.  WRKA has <br>
		been owned and opperated by Master Sapp for over 40 years and he continues <br>
		to strive to provide superior instruction and knowledge to all of his students. <br>
		In the early 1980s Grandmaster Ahn founded the Hae San Martial Arts Association, <br>
		where he appointed Master Sapp as Vice President.  He continues to serve <br>
		this position proudly. WRKA is a member of this fine organization.</b> <br>
